## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/uAEz9ZJPgOQ

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We added some functionality that makes the software more dynamic, such as being able to see the amount of tasks accomplished in percentages in the Sprint
> dashboard. Scrumbox is also much easier to use for the user from where we started with project.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Yes, the team worked hard and communicated effectively, but due to blockades from previous sprint, the 
> team ran into many issues working on features developed by others in previous sprint
> to be able to continue and complete the progress.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> No, I do not think the customer expectations were met, because a lot of the US from this sprint was unable
> to be finished

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> No, sprint goal to finish the product was not met.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Ran into issues integrating features developed by team in previous sprint
> Team members spent way too long on the class assignment 5b

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> While the team sprint will portray that most work was done towards the end, most members started working
> on their tasks early on in the sprint, but had to dedicate a lot of time to the assignment and ended up finishing towards the end

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes. Some business value was added. User Stories now calculate total points and total progress based on the progress from
> their tasks, the system creates a JSON file which is much easier to parse than XML files 

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Being able to communicate with the author of previous features will be great.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> The team feels that this sprint was overwhelming to complete in the given time.
