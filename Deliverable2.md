# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Scrumboard

**Sprint Number:** 2

**Scrum Master**: Fayez Mehdad

**Git Master**: Kevin Nguyen

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** The goal of this Sprint is to change Memoranda into a basic Scrum board and to focus on the UI. 

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  We added 2 User Stories to the backlog

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
>  8

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We added in these User Stories because they will change Memoranda into a preliminary Scrum board. We hope to accomplish most of the User Stories for Sprint 2.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> All of these User Stories pertain to updating the UI so that it represents a Scrum board. 

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we have a good idea of how to start Sprint 2.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> The value we created this sprint is that we transformed memoranda so it represents a Scrumboard. The program now resembles the basic components of a Scrumboard application with sprints, tasks, and a backlog. We hope to iterate it further during Sprint 3.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> As a team we worked towards the Sprint goal but since we had the wrong sprint end date, some team members were caught off-guard. Overall, most of the user stories were completed in Sprint 2.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Since this sprint focused on changing memoranda into a scrumboard and to focus on the UI, we did meet the customers’ expectation towards that goal. A customer is now able to create a board, a sprint and User Stories/Tasks and thus moving towards meeting the customer requirements. 

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes we did meet the sprint goal because it focused on the UI and thus we changed memoranda so it represents a scrumboard instead. 

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> Yes, we completed all of the User Stories in Sprint 2

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We made an improvement from Sprint 1. We are hoping that Sprint 3 will be consistent

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> There were members who worked in the beginning and others who worked towards the end of the sprint. There was also a member who worked consistently throughout. So the team was scattered when it came to their individual velocity. However, the breakdown chart is an improvement from Sprint 1 and we hope to accomplish all of the User Stories in Sprint 3.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes, business value was delivered because the memoranda now looks more like a scrumboard. Also, a user can create a user story/task.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Yes, better plan our sprints so we are able to do retro and review on time. There were also a couple of project requirements that we could have made into user stories such as unit tests so they are better tracked. So overall, we can better track our work/what the project wants us to focus on for that specific sprint and in addition of what we had discussed in Sprint 1 retro. 

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We are making progress and are hopeful for the last stretch of the project. The team feels like we need to focus in on Sprint 3 to ensure we make needed progress to complete the project on time.
