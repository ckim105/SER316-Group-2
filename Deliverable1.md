# Deliverable Information
> Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Scrumboard

**Sprint Number:** Sprint 1

**Scrum Master**: Sumbal Khan

**Git Master**: Chang Suk Kim

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation.

**Sprint Goal:**
> The goal of Sprint 1 is to get familiar with the existing code and to fix the easiest bugs and errors first.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**
> 12 (including sample ones)

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**
> Three new User Stories

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We added these User Stories because they reformat the existing tools of Memoranda to work for a Scrum board. This allows us to explore how Memoranda works to understand it better while also reusing existing code making it not as hard for us.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> This aligns with the goal as it allows us to explore and understand what bugs are in the Memoranda to fix and repurpose them.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, our group understands what our plan is for this Sprint.

## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|05/25/2022|None|Setup of Sprint 1 and assigning tasks|On track|Master passes|Zoom meeting|
|05/29/2022|Anna|Setup of standup and git channel, began icebreaker|On track|Master passes|Zoom meeting|
|05/29/2022|Anna|Everyone working on or completed first task|On track|Master passes|Standup Meeting|

|06/01/2022|Anna|Complete Sprint 1 retro and setup Sprint 2|On track|Master passes|Zoom meeting|

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

Sumbal Khan : 5

Kevin Nguyen : 5

Chang Suk Kim : 5

Fayez Mehdad : 5

Anna Lehner : 1

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/jAtXqKYaaNM

> Answer the following questions as a team.

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> The value we added in this sprint was to ensure the customer can use the program without running into the minor bugs that the program had.
We also rebranded memoranda so it will represent what the customer wants in a scrum board.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Yes, we accomplished the sprint goal which was to fix minor bugs and understand memoranda program.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We did work on rebranding memoranda to a scrum board but expectations of the customers are not fully met since the customer can’t utilize any scrum board features yet.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes the sprint goal was met because the tasks that related to our sprint goal which was to understand the memoranda program and fix bugs were all completed.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No, all stories were not completed in the Sprint. We planned the sprint backlog for a team of 5 people but only 4 people participated.
The stories that were not completed related to adding Scrum Board features which was not part of the sprint goal.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We were planning the work for a team of five but one of the team members did not participate in completing the tasks which is why we did not end up completing all the user stories in the sprint backlog.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> As a team, we did not. Some of the team worked in the beginning of the sprint and others towards the end of the sprint.
As a team we want to improve our velocity for sprint 2.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> No, we did not implement any scrum board features and therefore did not deliver any business value.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Yes, the team wants to work more consistently for the next sprint by adding more tasks and tracking it better.
Also, we want to improve our stand up meetings so the team knows where the other teammates are working on.
In addition, we want to commit to dev every time a task is completed instead of just committing when the user story is completed.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> The team feels good about what we were able to get done in Sprint 1. We are feeling optimistic for Sprint 2!
