# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Scrumboard

**Sprint Number:** Sprint 1

**Scrum Master**: Sumbal Khan

**Git Master**: Chang Suk Kim

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** 
> The goal of Sprint 1 is to get familiar with the existing code and to fix the easiest bugs and errors first.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  
> 12 (including sample ones)

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> Three new User Stories

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We added these User Stories because they reformat the existing tools of Memoranda to work for a Scrum board. This allows us to explore how Memoranda works to understand it better while also reusing existing code making it not as hard for us.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> This aligns with the goal as it allows us to explore and understand what bugs are in the Memoranda to fix and repurpose them.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, our group understands what our plan is for this Sprint.

## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|05/25/2022|None|Setup of Sprint 1 and assigning tasks|On track|Master passes|Zoom meeting|

### Meeting Summary:

   Sumbal Khan : 5

   Kevin Nguyen : 5
   
   Chang Suk Kim : 5
   
   Fayez Mehdad : 5

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."
