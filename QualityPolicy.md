### Quality Policy
> Describe your Quality Policy in detail for this Sprint (remember what I ask you to do when I talk about the "In your Project" part in the lectures and what is mentioned after each assignment (in due course you will need to fill out all of them, check which ones are needed for each Deliverable). You should keep adding things to this file and adjusting your policy as you go.
> Check in Project: Module Concepts document on Canvas in the Project module for more details 

**GitHub Workflow** (start Sprint 1)
  > We will create 1 branch per US using the format 'US# - Task'. When we commit, include the US# - Description in the commit or a description in order to correctly understand the commit. We create a Dev branch which all merges must go to first before it can be merged to master to ensure master is always a stable working version. When we do a pull request to merge to the master branch, another team member must test out the changes before it can be approved to be merged to the master branch. The Git Master will approve the merge if the review looks correct.
